# Conway's Game of Life
________

Using JavaScript and the React library, this cellular modulation first devised in 1970 by [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) demonstrates several of the basic mathmatic algorithms first realized in the 70s. The game will modulate cell life, resource scarcity, and overpopulation. The modulation can be paused, the board can be cleared, and the user may input cells to run through the tests. Message me with questions! A working version can be [found here](https://jpmcb.github.io/Conways-Game-of-Life/).
